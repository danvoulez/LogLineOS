# Alternative Runtime Designs

Below are additional concepts for implementing a LogLine engine.

## C++ JIT Compiler
- Parse contracts once and compile them into efficient machine code using a JIT library such as LLVM.
- Offers maximum performance for compute-heavy workflows.
- More complex to maintain but can interoperate with existing C++ ecosystems.

## Python Interpreter
- A pure Python engine for rapid prototyping or educational use.
- Simple to embed within data science workflows.
- Slower than the Go or Rust implementations but very accessible.

## Distributed Runtime
- Decompose contracts into tasks that run across a cluster.
- Each node hosts a minimal executor that streams spans back to a coordinator.
- Enables large scale automation with monitoring and fault tolerance.

These explorations can inform future iterations as the LogLine community grows.

## WASM Kernel with Rust Contracts
- Compile essential contracts into WebAssembly and execute them in a tiny
  WASI runtime. This isolates the kernel from the host OS and allows the
  same contracts to run in browsers or edge functions.

## GPU-accelerated Engine
- Translate hot paths of LogLine workflows into GPU shaders or compute kernels.
  Useful for data-heavy simulations or AI workloads.
