# Alternative Engines

While the current prototype is written in Go, other architectures could improve performance or flexibility:

1. **Rust-based Bytecode VM**
   - Compile LogLine scripts into custom bytecode.
   - Leverage Rust's memory safety and speed.
   - Suitable for embedding in other applications.

2. **JavaScript Runtime**
   - Translate LogLine into a JSON AST and execute in Node.js.
   - Benefit from vast npm ecosystem and quick iteration.

3. **WASM Execution**
   - Compile LogLine to WebAssembly for cross-platform use.
   - Allows running the same engine in browsers and servers.

Each approach has trade-offs in complexity and performance. See the main code for the reference Go implementation.
The repository also ships with `ui_runtime/`, a minimal browser engine to render LogLine contracts.
The `timeline/` module records spans in `.jsonl` files and can optionally sync to PostgreSQL.
The `gateway/` directory handles universal routing, API key checks, heartbeat spans and automatic fallback.



## Further Ideas

- **JIT-compiled Engine** – translate LogLine to an intermediate representation executed by a small virtual machine. Hot paths could be JIT compiled for speed similar to LuaJIT.
- **Serverless Runtime** – package LogLine workflows as small Lambda functions or Cloudflare Workers, enabling scalable deployments with minimal overhead.
- **Python Prototype** – quick experimentation by translating LogLine files into Python objects, leveraging the ecosystem for data science and rapid prototyping.
- **C++ Native Engine** – a highly optimized runtime with SIMD instructions for microcontrollers or performance-critical deployments.
